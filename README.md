## Project overview

This project uses the port of:

```
5500
```

To run this project I used python previously, but it is not working well with MIME, because some problems with header. I use live server plugin from Visual Studio Code now.

### Side Notes

\*I used also node.js, because I had some problems with accessing my service worker by python. I had some problems with MIME.
\*I changed to default port of live server.
