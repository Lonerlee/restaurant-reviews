# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project overview

This project uses the port of:

```
8030
```

To run this project I used python. To create server needed for all features of the page use this command in terminal:

```
python -m 8030 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

### Side Notes

\*I used also node.js, because I had some problems with accessing my service worker by python. I had some problems with MIME.
